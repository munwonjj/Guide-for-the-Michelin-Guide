# Project Michelin: Guide for the MICHELIN Guide

## Goal

This project aims to provide a data science solution for MICHELIN guide restaurant inspectors to be able to efficiently identify what areas of specific cuisine they would have to
expand on throughout the world. This project specifically explores the world-wide distribution of types of cuisiens selected by Michelin to potentially suggest cuisines that need
to be more introduced to the public. The ultimate business proposal of this project is to provide a model that can create a model to better target restaurants suitable to earn
Michelin stars without Michelin inspectors having to visit every restaurants during the pandemic.

The dataset comes from Kaggle consisting of 1000+ observations and is divided into three sections: One-star, Two-star, and Three-star Michelin restaurants.
Data cleaning for this project was done through google sheets and excel, and Tableau dashboard was used as the final data visualziation.
